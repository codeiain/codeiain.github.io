career-profile:
  title: Career Profile
  summary: |
    I am a Engineering Manager focused on building high-performing, empowered engineering teams. 
    My approach balances autonomy with structure, strengthening processes without creating unnecessary friction, 
    enabling teams to deliver efficiently and innovate consistently.

    Currently, I serve as Engineering Manager at Forrit, overseeing multiple teams across product delivery, 
    DevOps, and platform engineering. I focus on guiding the company from start-up to scale-up by introducing standardised 
    workflows, implementing DevOps practices, and embedding scalable delivery frameworks. I work closely with leadership 
    to align engineering strategy with business objectives, streamline processes, and drive sustainable improvements.

    Previously, I was Software Engineering Manager at Microlise, leading several development teams within the Integrated 
    Product Team (IPT). I managed 5–7 person teams delivering telematics and logistics software, focusing on technical 
    quality, delivery consistency, and cross-team collaboration. My work strengthened engineering alignment and supported 
    the company’s digital transformation goals.

    My earlier career spans technical leadership and hands-on development across agencies and enterprise systems. 
    I began as a QA tester at Rockstar North before moving into software development, progressing to senior engineer 
    and eventually into leadership roles, giving me a comprehensive understanding of the full development lifecycle.
