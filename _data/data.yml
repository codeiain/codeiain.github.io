  title: Career Profile
  summary: |
    I currently hold the position of Engineering Manager within Forrit, managing multiple engineering teams across product delivery, DevOps, and platform operations. 
    My primary focus is helping the company transition from a start-up to a scale-up by introducing DevOps practices, engineering standardisation, and scalable delivery frameworks. 
    I work closely with leadership to align engineering strategy with business goals and drive process automation and efficiency improvements.

    Prior to this, I was Software Engineering Manager at Microlise, working with five high-performing software engineering teams within the Integrated Product Team (IPT). 
    As well as line management of the teams, I actively managed the technical health of the IPT to achieve the company's OKRs and drive continuous improvement.

    I started my software career as a game’s tester for Rockstar North on GTA4, this gave me a good understanding of testing large-scale multi-player games, 
    I subsequently decided that I needed to expand my skills and made the move to software testing for a small Dunfermline-based company called Cooper Software. 
    As I was skilled in PHP, I was moved from testing to a project that required some PHP knowledge, and as Cooper Software is a .NET company, I was assigned this project.

    This kindled a love for developing software, so I learned VB.Net -- the preferred programming language for Cooper Software. 
    After working as a developer for over three years on multiple projects, including IFS integrations and bespoke web applications, I decided it was time for a developmental move.

    In 2012 I moved to a digital agency called Open Platform as a C# developer, working on their main product. 
    This was a great introduction to how digital agencies operate, and due to the nature of Open Platform, I was quickly pulled onto other projects including creating a fully bespoke game for Maersk Oil, 
    and multiple projects for Acer at the 2012 London Olympics.

    Open Platform merged with Swarm Online, an award-winning development company based in Glasgow. 
    My time with Swarm Online helped increase my knowledge of front-end frameworks including AngularJS and React Native, as well as server-side technologies.

    Working with GBG plc allowed me to expand into other languages and technologies such as Angular front-end applications and C#-based web APIs. 
    I was also involved in developing and designing microservices to replace legacy applications.

    Computershare allowed me to expand my abilities in mentoring other developers, refining my people management skills. 
    I worked on multiple projects within Global Development, actively contributing to the Dev Practice and helping design the future of the company’s technology landscape.
    
    Within Origo, my key responsibilities included migration to Azure DevOps for build and ticketing, mentoring junior developers, and promoting best practices throughout the development lifecycle.
    
    As Technical Lead / Solution Architect within Microlise, I guided the development of the Driver Distraction/Safe Camera System, ClearVision, and Drive Performance System, 
    as well as being an active member of the TLSA community and multiple Communities of Practice.
